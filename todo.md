High-Level Tasks for Building and Deploying the Dice App

Week 1: Initial Setup and Core Development

Project Setup

Set up the repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

Define project structure and install dependencies (Three.js, WebGL, etc.).

Establish coding guidelines and documentation standards.

Core UI and 3D Dice Rendering

Implement UI controls (dropdowns, buttons, inputs for dice selection).

Integrate Three.js for rendering 3D dice.

Develop dice rolling animation and result display.

Basic Functionality Implementation

Allow users to select the number of dice and throws.

Calculate and display dice roll results.

Implement modifier functionality for dice rolls.

Week 2: Enhancements and SEO Integration
4. Optimization and Enhancements

Improve UI/UX with animations and smooth interactions.

Implement mobile responsiveness.

Optimize performance and loading speed.

SEO and Search Engine Integration

Define keywords ("dice", "roll", "D&D dice roller", etc.).

Implement metadata and structured data for better indexing.

Develop an embed-friendly version for integration into Google search results.

Testing and Bug Fixing

Conduct unit testing for core functions.

Test animations and physics consistency.

Fix UI and functionality bugs.

Week 3: Deployment Preparation and Marketing
7. Deployment Setup

Choose hosting solution (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.).

Configure CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment.

Set up monitoring and analytics tools.

User Engagement Features

Implement shareable links for rolled results.

Add a simple leaderboard (optional).

Gather initial user feedback for improvements.

Final Testing and Soft Launch

Perform end-to-end testing.

Conduct a soft launch with limited users.

Collect feedback and iterate before full deployment.

Week 4: Full Deployment and Marketing Push
10. Full Deployment
- Deploy the final version to production.
- Monitor performance and resolve any post-launch issues.
- Conduct load testing and scalability checks.

Marketing and User Acquisition

Announce the launch via social media, blogs, and communities.

Reach out to gaming and dice-related communities.

Set up basic ad campaigns for visibility.

Post-Launch Improvements

Analyze user behavior and feedback.

Plan future updates based on usage data.

Maintain and update the application as needed.

Goal:

Soft launch by the end of Week 3.

Full public deployment by the end of Week 4.

Step-by-Step Tasks for Week 1:

Day 1: Project Setup

Task: Create repository, set up project structure, and install dependencies.

Steps:

Create Repository

Go to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and create a new repository.

Add a README file, .gitignore, and appropriate license.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Set Up Project Structure

Create main folders: src/ for source files, public/ for static assets, and tests/ for testing.

Add initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Ensure a clean file structure with meaningful names.

Install Dependencies

Install Node.js if not already installed.

Run npm init -y to initialize a package.json file.

Install required dependencies like three.js using npm install three.

Definition of Done:

A functional repository is created and pushed with an initial commit.

Project structure is in place with meaningful file organization.

All necessary dependencies are installed and ready for development.

Definition of Done: A functional project repository with basic setup committed.

Day 2: UI Implementation

Task: Design UI components (dropdowns, roll button, result display) and implement event listeners.

Definition of Done: Basic UI elements appear on screen and respond to interactions.

Day 3: 3D Dice Rendering

Task: Integrate Three.js, create 3D dice models, and render them dynamically.

Definition of Done: Dice appear on the canvas and respond to user selections.

Day 4: Rolling Animation

Task: Implement physics-based rolling animation and calculate realistic rotations.

Definition of Done: Dice animate upon rolling and land correctly with a visible result.

Day 5: Core Functionality

Task: Implement logic for dice rolls, including modifiers and multiple dice selection.

Definition of Done: Users can roll multiple dice, and results update correctly.

Day 6: Basic Testing & Debugging

Task: Test UI and rendering for responsiveness, debug animations and physics.

Definition of Done: No major bugs affecting usability; smooth animation and interaction.

Day 7: Code Review & Documentation

Task: Conduct code cleanup, write README with setup and usage instructions.

Definition of Done: A well-documented and structured codebase ready for enhancements.
