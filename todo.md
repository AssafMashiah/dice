# High-Level Tasks for Building and Deploying the Dice App

## Week 1: Initial Setup and Core Development
### 1. Project Setup
- Set up the repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Define project structure and install dependencies (Three.js, WebGL, etc.).
- Establish coding guidelines and documentation standards.

### 2. Core UI and 3D Dice Rendering
- Implement UI controls (dropdowns, buttons, inputs for dice selection).
- Integrate Three.js for rendering 3D dice.
- Develop dice rolling animation and result display.

### 3. Basic Functionality Implementation
- Allow users to select the number of dice and throws.
- Calculate and display dice roll results.
- Implement modifier functionality for dice rolls.

## Week 2: Enhancements and SEO Integration
### 4. Optimization and Enhancements
- Improve UI/UX with animations and smooth interactions.
- Implement mobile responsiveness.
- Optimize performance and loading speed.

### 5. SEO and Search Engine Integration
- Define keywords ("dice", "roll", "D&D dice roller", etc.).
- Implement metadata and structured data for better indexing.
- Develop an embed-friendly version for integration into Google search results.

### 6. Testing and Bug Fixing
- Conduct unit testing for core functions.
- Test animations and physics consistency.
- Fix UI and functionality bugs.

## Week 3: Deployment Preparation and Marketing
### 7. Deployment Setup
- Choose hosting solution (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.).
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployment.
- Set up monitoring and analytics tools.

### 8. User Engagement Features
- Implement shareable links for rolled results.
- Add a simple leaderboard (optional).
- Gather initial user feedback for improvements.

### 9. Final Testing and Soft Launch
- Perform end-to-end testing.
- Conduct a soft launch with limited users.
- Collect feedback and iterate before full deployment.

## Week 4: Full Deployment and Marketing Push
### 10. Full Deployment
- Deploy the final version to production.
- Monitor performance and resolve any post-launch issues.
- Conduct load testing and scalability checks.

### 11. Marketing and User Acquisition
- Announce the launch via social media, blogs, and communities.
- Reach out to gaming and dice-related communities.
- Set up basic ad campaigns for visibility.

### 12. Post-Launch Improvements
- Analyze user behavior and feedback.
- Plan future updates based on usage data.
- Maintain and update the application as needed.

## Goal:
- Soft launch by the end of Week 3.
- Full public deployment by the end of Week 4.

## Step-by-Step Tasks for Week 1

### Day 1: Project Setup
- **Task:** Create repository, set up project structure, and install dependencies.

#### Steps:
1. **Create Repository**
   - Go to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and create a new repository.
   - Add a README file, .gitignore, and appropriate license.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Create main folders: `src/` for source files, `public/` for static assets, and `tests/` for testing.
   - Add initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
   - Ensure a clean file structure with meaningful names.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install Node.js if not already installed.
   - Run `npm init -y` to initialize a package.json file.
   - Install required dependencies like `three.js` using `npm install three`.

**Definition of Done:**
- A functional repository is created and pushed with an initial commit.
- Project structure is in place with meaningful file organization.
- All necessary dependencies are installed and ready for development.

### Day 2: UI Implementation
- **Task:** Design UI components (dropdowns, roll button, result display) and implement event listeners.
- **Definition of Done:** Basic UI elements appear on screen and respond to interactions.

### Day 3: 3D Dice Rendering
- **Task:** Integrate Three.js, create 3D dice models, and render them dynamically.
- **Definition of Done:** Dice appear on the canvas and respond to user selections.

### Day 4: Rolling Animation
- **Task:** Implement physics-based rolling animation and calculate realistic rotations.
- **Definition of Done:** Dice animate upon rolling and land correctly with a visible result.

### Day 5: Core Functionality
- **Task:** Implement logic for dice rolls, including modifiers and multiple dice selection.
- **Definition of Done:** Users can roll multiple dice, and results update correctly.

### Day 6: Basic Testing & Debugging
- **Task:** Test UI and rendering for responsiveness, debug animations and physics.
- **Definition of Done:** No major bugs affecting usability; smooth animation and interaction.

### Day 7: Code Review & Documentation
- **Task:** Conduct code cleanup, write README with setup and usage instructions.
- **Definition of Done:** A well-documented and structured codebase ready for enhancements.
